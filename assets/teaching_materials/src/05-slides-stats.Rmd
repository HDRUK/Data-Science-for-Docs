## What is statisitcs?

Statistics is the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, displaying, analysis, interpretation and presentation of data

Statistics is the science of learning from data

Statistics != Hypothesis Testing

---

## What is data science?

Arguably a rebranding of statistics.

---

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.height=500}
knitr::include_graphics("images/venn_data_science.jpeg")
```

---

## the Big Picture

- Draw a sample from a population
- inspecting it, organising it, summarising it: Descriptive statistics
- draw conclusions about the population: Inferential statistics

---

## How not to do statisitcs

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.height=500}
knitr::include_graphics("images/stats_flow_chart.jpg")
```

---

## Fundamental Principles of Statistics

- Use methods that are well understood and validated
- Emphasize uncertainty
- Maximise information use
- Use procedures that are less likely to claim noise is signal
- Present information intuatively

---

## Types of analysis

- Descriptive
- Inferential
  - Hypothesis Testing
  - Estimation
  - Prediction

---

## Measure types

- Binary: yes/no
- Count: theoretical no upper limit, bound at zero
- Continuous
- Discrete
    - Nominal
    - Ordinal 

---

## Descriptive Statistics

- How to describe a distribution of data
- Use a mechanism to convey the underlying mechanism

---

- Binary: proportion of yes's
- categorical: probability of group membership
- Continuous:
  - Probability Density (recognisable, but difficult to work with)
  - Cumulative Density (easy to work with, but not particularly recognisable)
  - Moments:
    - Mean
    - Variance (standard deviation)
    - Skew
    - Kurtosis

## The Utility of having a named distribtion

- Helps in making predictions in the future
- Very reasonable assumption to draw inferences

## Types of discrete variables

- Nominal 
    - e.g. hair colour, types of antibiotics 
    - There is no order between the data types (e.g. blonde, brunette, red hair)

## Types of discrete variables

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
- Ordinal 
    - There is an order e.g. `care_level` where Level 3 > Level 2 > Level 1 etc.
    - However, the difference between Level 1 and Level 2 critical care may not be the same as the difference between Level 2 and Level 3. 
:::
::: {.column}

::::::::::::::

## Types of discrete data

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
- Interval
    - There is an order to data points (e.g. `age_cat` for age centile) and the difference
    between these points are equal (e.g. 10 years)

## Describing data

- Continuous variables
- Discrete variables

::: notes
How do we convey information on what your data looks like, using numbers or figures?
:::

## Describing continuous data.

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
First establish the distribution of the data. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(cchic, aes(x = age_years)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

What is the distribution of this data?
:::
::: {.column}
![](../Images/AgeDistribution.png)
:::
::::::::::::::

::: notes
Get them to do this with you.

## What is the distribution of height?

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

Try this command

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = cchic, aes(x = height)) +
  geom_histogram()
```
What is the distribution of this data?

## Parametric vs non-parametric data

- Parametric data
    - The data follows a known distribution
    - It can be described using *parameters*
    - Examples of distributions include, normal, poission, exponential.

- Non parametric data
    - The data can't be said to follow a known distribution

::: notes
Emphasise that parametric is not equal to normal.
:::

## Describing parametric and non-parametric data

How do you use numbers to convey what your data looks like.

- Parametric data 
    - Use the parameters that describe the distribution.
    - For a Gaussian (normal) distribution - use mean and standard deviation
    - For a Poission distribution - use average event rate
    - etc.
- Non Parametric data
    - Use the median (the middle number when they are ranked from lowest to highest) and the interquartile range (the number 75% of the way up the list when ranked minus the number 25% of the way)

- You can use the command `summary(data_frame_name)` to get these numbers for each variable.

## Mean versus standard deviation

- What does standard deviation mean?
- Both graphs have the same mean (center), but the second one has data which is more spread out.

```{r, eval = FALSE}

# small standard deviation
dummy_1 <- rnorm(1000, mean = 10, sd = 0.5)
dummy_1 <- as.data.frame(dummy_1)
ggplot(dummy_1, aes(x = dummy_1)) +
  geom_histogram()

# larger standard deviation
dummy_2 <- rnorm(1000, mean = 10, sd = 20)
dummy_2 <- as.data.frame(dummy_2)
ggplot(dummy_2, aes(x = dummy_2)) +
  geom_histogram()
```


::: notes
Get them to plot the graphs. Explain that we are generating ramdom data from different distributions and plotting them. 
::: 

## Calculating mean and standard deviation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mean(cchic$height, na.rm = TRUE)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
sd(cchic$height, na.rm = TRUE)
```

The `na.rm` argument tells R to ignore missing values in the variable. What happens if you leave it out?

## Calculating median and interquartile range

```{r, eval = FALSE}
median(cchic$age_years, na.rm = TRUE)
```
```{r, eval = FALSE}
IQR(cchic$age_years, na.rm = TRUE)
```

Again, we ignore the missing values.

## Describing discrete data

- Frequencies
```{r, eval = FALSE}
table(cchic$care_level)
```

- Proportions
```{r, eval = FALSE}
care <- table(cchic$care_level)
prop.table(care)
```

- Percentatages
```{r, eval = FALSE}
PercTable(care)
```

## Meaningful analysis

- What is your hypothesis

- What type of variables (data type) do you have?

- What are the assumptions of the test you are using?

- Interpreting the result

## What is a p-value?

![](../Images/pValue.png)

## What we are usually hoping...

![](../Images/pValue2.png)

## Testing significance

- p-value

- <0.05

- 0.03-0.049
    - Would benefit from further testing. 
    
## Comparing means

It all starts with a hypothesis

- Null hypothesis
    - “There is no difference in mean height between men and women”

- Alternate hypothesis
    - “There is a difference in mean height between men and women”
    
## More on hypothesis testing

- The null hypothesis (H0) assumes that the true mean difference (μd) is equal to zero.
- The two-tailed alternative hypothesis (H1) assumes that μd is not equal to zero.
- The upper-tailed alternative hypothesis (H1) assumes that μd is greater than zero.
- The lower-tailed alternative hypothesis (H1) assumes that μd is less than zero.


- Remember: hypotheses are never about data, they are about the processes which produce the data. The value of μd is unknown. The goal of hypothesis testing is to determine the hypothesis (null or alternative) with which the data are more consistent.

## Comparing means

Is there a difference between the heights of males and females?

```{r}
cchic %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarise(av.height = mean(height, na.rm = TRUE))
```
    
Is the difference between heights statistically significant?

::: notes
Note that these number may not be the same as the one candidates see on their screens. These slides are based on a smaller version of the dataset.

## t-test

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
- Compares means between two populations
- Paired vs. Unpaired
:::
::: {.column}
![](../Images/Ttest.png)
:::
::::::::::::::

## Assumptions of a t-test

- One independent categorical variable with 2 groups and one dependent continuous variable

- The dependent variable is approximately normally distributed in each group

- The observations are independent of each other

## Doing a t-test

```{r, eval = FALSE}
t.test(height ~ sex, data = cchic)
```

::: notes
Tell them to do this.
:::

## Doing the t-test

```{r, echo = FALSE}
t.test(height ~sex, data = cchic)
```

::: notes
Quickly explain the main points of the output
:::

## Comparing counts

- Is survival different between genders?

```{r}
table(cchic$sex, cchic$vital_status)
```

## What is our hypothesis?

- Null hypothesis
    - There is no difference in survival between men and women 
    
- Alternate hypothesis
    - There is  a difference in survival between men and women 
    
## Assumptions of the chi-squared test.

1.  Data in cells should be frequencies or counts *not* percentages
2.  Levels/Categories are mutually exclusive – here being a alive/dead applies
3.  Each subject contributes to one cell – can either be male/female and alive/dead
4.  Independent study groups
5.  2 categorical variables
6.  Values in each cell should be 5+

`Biochem Med (Zagreb). 2013 Jun; 23(2): 143–149.`

## Doing the chi-squared test.

Start with `?chisq.test`. 
Then do the test.

```{r}
# Changing the character vector to a factor one so that it works with the function.
cchic <- cchic %>%
  mutate(gender = as.factor(sex))
# Doing the test.
chisq.test(cchic$gender, cchic$vital_status)
```

::: notes
Get them to do this, then explain the output.

## Non paramteric versions

Is length of stay different between genders?

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
![Male](../Images/LOSMale.png)
:::
::: {.column}
![Female](../Images/LOSFemale.png)
:::
::::::::::::::

## When do you use a non-parametric test?

- When any of the the following are true.
    - Level of measurement is nominal or ordinal
    - Unequal sample sizes
    - Skewed data
    - Unequal variance
    - Continuous data collapsed into small number of categories

## Using the Mann Whitney test

`??Mann-Whitney` will show you that the command is actually called `wilcox.test`.

Both variables need to be in numeric format.

```{r}
cchic <- cchic %>%
  mutate(los_num = as.numeric(los))
```

## Doing the test

```{r}
wilcox.test(los_num ~ sex, data = cchic)
```
