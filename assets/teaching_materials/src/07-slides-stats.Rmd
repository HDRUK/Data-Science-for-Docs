## Content

- Descriptive Statistics - Descibing your data
- Pitfalls of Inference - Power, P values and Confidence Infervals

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the session you should be able to:

- Be able to describe data effectively.
- Use basic statistics terminology correctly.
- Understand statistical power, p values and confidence intervals.
- Know where to go next for help.

## What is statisitcs?

Statistics is the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, displaying, analysis, interpretation and presentation of data

Statistics is the science of learning from data

Statistics != Hypothesis Testing

# What is data science?

---

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.height=500}
knitr::include_graphics("images/venn_data_science.jpeg")
```

---

## the Big Picture

- Draw a sample from a population
- inspecting it, organising it, summarising it: Descriptive statistics
- draw conclusions about the population: Inferential statistics

---

## How not to do statisitcs

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.height=500}
knitr::include_graphics("images/stats_flow_chart.jpg")
```

## Types of analysis

- Descriptive
- Inferential

---

## Measure types

- Binary: yes/no
- Count: natually bound at zero
- Continuous
- Discrete
    - Nominal
    - Ordinal

---

## Descriptive Statistics

- How to describe a distribution of data
- Use a mechanism to convey the underlying mechanism

---

- Binary: proportion of yes's
- categorical: probability of group membership
- Continuous:
  - Probability Density (recognisable, but difficult to work with)
  - Cumulative Density (easy to work with, but not particularly recognisable)
  - Moments:
    - Mean
    - Variance (standard deviation)
    - Skew
    - Kurtosis
